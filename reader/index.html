        As someone whose livelihood revolves around news, I’ve never been too keen on this saying, even though I understand it’s trying to convey that what’s important today will soon be forgotten.
    </div>
    
    <div class="p2">
        But quite aside from the fact that fish and chips are no longer wrapped in newspaper, the saying has become completely outdated in today’s digital world.
    </div>

    <div class="p3">
        Gone are the days of out of sight, out of mind as there are so many sources where people get their news fix including news websites, social media and blogs.

        <p>And it’s not just news that gets this treatment but every area of our life as the microscope of the modern world means things that we’d prefer remained forgotten can suddenly resurface and come back to haunt us.</p>

        <p> It’s with nostalgic fondness we can reflect on all those terrible photographs of us when we were younger with awful haircuts, goofy teeth and horrendous clothes which are safely hidden away in our parents’ home in a dusty photo album with plastic sheets which have lost all of their stickiness.</p>

    Wouldn’t it be dreadful if all these embarrassing snaps were unearthed and posted for all and sundry to see?

    <div class="p6">
        That’s the reality for the youngsters of today who often have everything from their scan picture onwards posted all over social media – at least all we had to worry about was our mum and dad bringing out photo albums in front of our friends.

        And even encounters you’d thought you’d brushed under the carpet or cringe worthy blunders you hoped had been wiped from everyone’s memory can have a habit of rearing their ugly head when you least expect it.It’s not just photos that can be the problem – but live footage too as you never know who might be filming.

    <div class="p8">
        There’s another saying: 
    </div>

    <div class="p8-5">
        “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.”

    <div class="p9">
    ...Unless of course you have a friend with a mobile phone and a Facebook or Twitter account...
